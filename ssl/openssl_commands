** Certificate Creation

# To generate an RSA Private Key and CSR for a certificate - Do this on the customer's server:
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/pki/tls/private/<year>-<commonname>.key -out /etc/pki/tls/misc/<year>-<commonname>.csr

# Create a file containing key and self-signed certificate
# Great for when you get Invalid cert issues in webmin
# to use in webmin make the keyout and cert file /etc/webmin/miniserv.pem
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 3652 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mycert.pem -out mycert.pem

** Certificate Verification

# Test out the key/cert - the modulus of both files must match.
openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in <name>.key
openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in <name>.crt

# print out certificate details - You can also leave out the '-in' 
# statement and paste in the certificate file 
# everything 
openssl x509 -text -noout -in <filename>

# who issued the cert?
openssl x509 -noout -in <filename> -issuer

# to whom was it issued?
openssl x509 -noout -in <filename> -subject

# for what dates is it valid?
openssl x509 -noout -in <filename> -dates

# the above, all at once
openssl x509 -noout -in <filename> -issuer -subject -dates


** Certificate conversion 
# key and cert file to a PEM
pem is just a key then cert in one file
cat sslkey.key > file.pem && cat sslcert.crt >> file.pem

# to go from PFX to PEM
openssl pkcs12 -in mycert.pfx -out mycert.pem -nodes

# export mycert.pem as PKCS#12 file, mycert.pfx
openssl pkcs12 -export -out mycert.pfx -in mycert.pem -name "My Certificate"

# to remove ssl passphrase on the key
openssl rsa -in OLD.key -out NEW.key2

# view cert info remotely
openssl s_client -connect url:port


# one liner to grab the ips 
# put them all in the file ips
for i in `cat ips` ; do echo " ip $i has certificate: " ; echo quit | openssl s_client -connect $i:443 2>&1 | grep ubject  ; done
