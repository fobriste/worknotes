Software requirements:
64-bit OS
PHP 5.2.x
MySQL 5.0.x

Before you begin:
-Contact the customer and ask them what the domain name will be for the
eventual production site. You will use this domain name as the SSH user
for managing the site, the database name, and the MySQL user. For the
system user, MySQL user, and MySQL database name, drop the TLD off of
the domain name. For example, "rackspace.com" would be "rackspace".

Preparing the server to run Magento:
PHP
-Subscribe web server(s) to the PHP 5.2 RPM channel. Upgrade PHP to the
latest PHP 5.2.x release. Install the following additional PHP modules:
        -php-gd
        -php-mcrypt
        -php-mhash
        -php-xml
        -php-pecl-memcache
        -php-pecl-apc
-Ensure that safe_mode is disabled in the php.ini
-Ensure that APC is enabled in /etc/php.d/apc.ini
-Increase the APC apc.shm_size from 32 to 100 in /etc/php.d/apc.ini
-Set the session.save_handler to memcache
-Set the session.save_path to
"tcp://localhost:11211?persistent=1&weight;=1&timeout;=1&retry;_interval=15"
(see notes on multi-server install below)

Memcache
-Install memcachced, start service and configure to start at boot (see
notes on multi-server install below)

MySQL
-Subscribe database server(s) to the MySQL 5.0.x RPM channel. Upgrade
MySQL to the latest MySQL 5.0.x release
-Create a database called "magento_<sitename>"
-Create a database user called "<sitename>" with access to the new database

Apache
-Ensure that "AllowOverride" is set to "All" for the document root of
the Magento site (or for the global /var/www/html definition if no
specific virtual host)
-Ensure that "FollowSymLinks" is enabled for the document root of the
Magento site (or for the global /var/www/html definition if no specific
virtual host)

Network
-Ensure that both ports 80 and 443 are globally accessible through the
customer's firewall
-Ensure that the /etc/hosts file is updated on each of the web servers
so that there are entries for the eventual production domain pointing at
the local private IP address

OS
-Create a user with SSH access for managing the site. Use the value for
<sitename> from above. Give this user ownership of the domain's document
root

Additional notes for multiple Web server environments
Memcache (multi server)
-Choose one server to run memcache, comment out the "ADDRESS" line in
/etc/sysconfig/memcache and restart memcache. This will tell memcache to
listen on all interfaces rather than just localhost

PHP (multi server)
-Set the session.save_path on each of the servers that are not running
memcache to point at the server running the memcache daemon

Network
-Ensure that any SSL certificates are configured on the servers
directly. Magento will not function properly if the SSL termination is
offloaded to the load balancer
