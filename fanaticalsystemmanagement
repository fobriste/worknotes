Each week the following should be performed for a Linux FSM server:

1)  Look at the last week's tickets and base your weekly report on last week's FSM report
2)  Use "FSM: Weekly Server# 31797 Check" in subject line of this week's ticket
3)  Notate disk usage to customer and warn them if they are low on disk space or have experienced high disk usage in the last week.
4)  Check http://www.redhat.com for lastest errata for the RH version
    - Only patch what is on the server
    - Do not update things like OpenSSL, kernels, BIND, Apache, MySQL, or other possible operation interrupting patches without consulting the customer.
    - Tell the customer what software you updated.
5)  Do all of your work in /home/rack/FSM<tab-complete>
    - There will be directory structures as either FSMupdates or just FSM
    - Run rpm -Va |grep "^..5" > rpmverify-YYYYMMDD & in the /home/rack/FSM<tab-complete/.rpm<tab-complete> 
      * Try to keep only 4 weeks worth of rpm-verify data
    - diff last week's verify with this week's to make sure nothing has changed from last time
6)  Check if Backup Exec client for Linux is running (agent.be)
    -> Troubleshoot any backup issues that you find
7)  Grep 'kernel' from /var/log/messages
8)  httpd -t
    - Report even warnings to the customer
9)  Check Apache logs and report any problems
    - Even if customer is running 3rd party products, let them know of the errors you find
10)  Make sure time is properly set.  If not: service ntpd restart
    - Then: hwclock --systohc
11) Do an 'ipconfig' and make sure the server is not encountering collisions
12) Look over ps -auxwg to ensure nothig out of the ordinary is running.
13) Do a netstat -natp |grep -i listen  to make sure there are no weird ports listening
14) Look at the 'last' log to see if anyone weird logged in
15) Report all information you find running fine or otherwise in the following format:
