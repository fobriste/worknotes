Spam comes from several sources: Whitelisted IP, scripts, processes, auth'd users, apache php or cgi, or users

The first place to check is /var/qmail/bin/qmail-qstat to determine queue size. over 1000 is suspicious.
Then /var/qmail/bin/qmail-qread will dump the queue.
look for a pattern, find one then look at a message. Get the message id from the qmail-qread and you can find the file or qmHandle -R<messageID>.

Get ident info from the mail, and see where it's from. In the case I wrote the howto it was a whitelisted ip. You view the whitelisted ip's via the plesk control panel in mail or grom the smtp_poplocks table.

mysql -uadmin -p`cat /etc/psa/.psa.shadow ` psa
mysql> select * from smtp_poplocks;

remove the ip's from the whitelist and put them in the ticket so the customer will have them for reference. Then remove the badmail. Here's how:

/var/qmail/bin/qmail-qread | grep \.hinet\.net | grep GMT | awk '{print $6}' | sed s/^#/-d/ > ~rack/badmail

qmHandle `cat ~rack/badmail`

### new stuff - 

qmHandle -L | awk '/Subject/ {print $2}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n #prints subjects by frequency
