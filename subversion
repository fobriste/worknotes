#setting up with webdav

1. You need to create the respository and it need to be owned by apache

e.g

# To create a new repository "http://localhost/repos/stuff" using
# this configuration, run as root:
#
 cd /var/www/svn
  svnadmin create project
   chown -R apache.apache project


   2. Enable the following with your virtual host

   <Location /repos>
      DAV svn
      SVNParentPath /var/www/svn
      ###Enable the following for password protection to your webdav
      AuthType Basic
      AuthName "Authorization Realm"
      AuthUserFile /path/to/passwdfile
      Require valid-user
    </Location>


After that, you can then use the following URL to connect to your repository project.

                                 svn checkout http://mydomain.com/repos/stuff
